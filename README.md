# what this is
There are going to be a lot of school projects here and some random R code. Nothing from my original undergrad is here, nor my work prior to 2021.
This probably shouldn't be called a portfolio, since the vast majority of my real tools are tied up in closed-source partnerships and teams.

# assignments
Self-explanatory. 

# python
Proof that I can do the basics and the big things. Designed with teaching and explanation in-mind.
My goal with these is to explain what I did to someone who is very new to python. Think Feynman technique.

## projects
See my other projects such as:

``` spiteful-arpg ```

A brief dive into pygame development. I left for the army right when I started. Intention is to integrate cython with pygame to build a mini ARPG.
