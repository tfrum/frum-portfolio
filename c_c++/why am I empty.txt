I bought a new enclosure for my backup drives in 2021.
It overheated while I was asleep.
Drive 1 failed. I backed up its contents to drive 2, which then also failed.
The third backup drive failed trying to rescue contents from it later that day.

Three server drives dead to an overheated enclosure in a single day, all with platter crashes.
I buy SSDs now.
