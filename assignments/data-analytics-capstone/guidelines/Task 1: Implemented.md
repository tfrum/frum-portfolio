# Summary of Capstone Proposal: "Exploring Genre in Steam Game Sales and Marketing"

## Overview
**Project Topic:**  
Analyze long-term sales data, reviews, and store metrics from Steam games to identify trends in game genres, exploring their social-psychological and cultural implications. The project will provide insights into the $280 billion video game industry by studying genre momentum, market shifts, and consumer values over the past 30 years.

**Research Question:**  
How do shifts in sales volume, publishing volume, and other metrics on a per-genre basis predict changes in the gaming market and broader trends?

**Hypothesis:**  
Traditional game genres remain relevant in absolute terms despite market evolution.
