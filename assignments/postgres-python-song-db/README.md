# CREATE TABLES
Let's decipher what the project wants us to do, because like all Udacity projects, it was written by an anteater
on a 2017 base model macbook in 2017 and deployed using an undergraduate's boutique version of docker in a jupyter notebook.

We're going to just do this as a step by step:

# Step 1 - Prep
First we set up our create_tables.py file, which was straight forward enough.
We're provied all the information we need to make these. I formatted them to be readable.

# Step 2
Run `%run create_tables.py` so execute that python program and populate the database.
If we try to run test.ipynb right now, we'll get zero rows returned because we need to do our ETL.
It will close out of the database on its own without modification. 

# Step 3 - ETL
